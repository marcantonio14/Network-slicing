\section{Introduction}
Mobile networks are a fundamental topic for modern society because they guarantee communications and access
to information on a tap of our fingers. Furthermore we expect that the data flowing per month will be around 50 exabytes and this is caused mainly by video services.
Indeed in the last years, mobile operators are moving from a voice-oriented infrastructures to
data-oriented ones and they are not able to keep pace with the calculated traffic volume. Facing such new problems, operators have
invested a lot in research efforts toward the designing of the Fifth Generation mobile architecture, in order to provide innovative solutions for new capabilities and revenue sources. Network slicing is one of proposed innovation to push forward the frontier of mobile communications and it will discussed in this overview.\\
5G Network slicing allows \gls{mno} to share
physical infrastructures they have to the simultaneous deployment
of multiple independent logical networks, managed with respect
to their specific service requirements. 
%The availability of this vertical market\footnote{A vertical market is a group of companies that serve each other's specialized needs and do not serve a broader market, therefore it is mostly focused on meeting the needs of one specific industry.} multiplies
%the money incoming opportunities of the network infrastructure as new
%opportunities come into play (e.g., automotive industry, e-health) and an higher
%infrastructure capacity utilization can be achieved by letting network slice
%requests and exploiting multiplexing gains.\\
For example, different services like automotive, tactile internet or massive IoT can be put in practice by exploiting different network slice
instances, that is a set of virtual network functions
that run on the same infrastructure with customized policies. Thanks to that,
heterogeneous requirements can run on the same infrastructure, since
different instances can be orchestrated and set independently
according to the specifics requested. Furthermore, this is executed in a
costly efficient way because as the a network slice shares the same
physical infrastructure with different slices.\\
A network slice is defined by \gls{ngmn} as “\textit{a set of network functions, and
resources to run these network functions, forming a complete instantiated
logical network to meet certain network characteristics required by the Service
Instance(s)}”.\\
According to NGMN, the concept of network slicing is ideally composed by: the \gls{sil} that involves the business/end user services provided by operators or by the party which leases the services by the operators; the \gls{nsil} is set of functions to run the instances and the resource layer, which consists of the
resources such as compute, network, memory, storage.\\
The target of slicing is to realize
\gls{e2e} network slices from the mobile edge,
through the mobile transport (\gls{fh}/\gls{bh}) and up until
\gls{CN}.\\
The two main tools needed to allow different degrees
of control and automation in NSIL and resource layers are: the \gls{vi} under the control and operation
of different tenants in agreement with an \gls{IaaS} model\footnote{Form of cloud computing providing computed and virtualized resources over the internet} to split information from used hardware; \gls{NS} owned by tenants, that is actually creation of a service instance.
The VIs can be operated by \gls{sdn}, NS are instantiated directly over a shared infrastructure
and as a set of \gls{VNF} connected through
one or more VNF forwarding graphs are necessary to define the life cycle of the slice; both of them will be discussed later.\\
Multi-tenancy is an characteristic that must be achieved to guarantee separation, isolation, and independence between
different slices decoupled from the shared underlying resources.\\

\label{layers}
\end{figure}
After this general overview this essay will treat accurately all the necessary fundamental components in order to fully understand how 5G network slicing is planned actually to be built. \cite{al20185g} \cite{marsch20185g}


\newpage
\section{Structural components} 
Starting from how an architecture for network slicing is conceptually made, it will be explained what it should achieve and involve, that is, the aspects of modularization, resource virtualization, virtual infrastructure and NS management; they will be the main topics of this section.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.67]{pics/2.JPG}
\caption{Architecture for network slicing. \cite{al20185g}} 
\label{Arch}
\end{figure}
As anticipated about virtualization of the infrastructure, the SDN design is proposed in Fig. \ref{Arch} and follows the principles of:
\begin{itemize}
\item data and control plane fully decoupled;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item control logically centralized;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item applications having an abstracted view of resources and states.
\end{itemize}
The data plane is actually the resource layer where mobile edge, mobile transport, and core are present. The infrastructure is made of links, forwarding nodes like a router or a switch, cloud nodes  and a set of network, computing and storage resources.\\
The control plane is divided into two layers: an application layer at the top and at the bottom the \gls{MANO}. \\
The design of the MANO is based on the ETSI management and orchestration of the network by means of a framework exploiting SDN-based control. The MANO
provides a panoramic of the resources available by means of \gls{NBI}, instead it is linked to data plane
entities by means of \gls{SBI} to execute control and management
functions on the actual hardware components (possible application to do the job are OpenFlow, SNMP, OVSDB).
For what concerns the \gls{MTA}, it realizes the
multi-tenancy support because it applies a coordination of the tenants accessing the infrastructure shared by the clients: so in order to do that it performs isolation of resource assigned to various instances of
different tenants, and implements services related to
allocation and operation of VIs using some dedicated \gls{API}\footnote{it is the code that permits softwares to create a communication among each other.}. \\
As shown in Fig. \ref{Arch} the choice of APIs depends on the kind of service. \cite{al20185g} \cite{ohlen2016data}

\subsection{Enablers and Design Principles}
Future 5G networks will be built on concepts absolutely not related with the previous generation
network architectures. In the Fifth generation a revolution is actually provided by the introduction of SDN
and \gls{NFV}\footnote{Although NFV and VNF are often used without distinction, for the sake of clarity NFV is a general concept, instead the VNF is a building block of the NFV framework.} opening the doors to a
new huge number of applications, recalling that the latter focuses primarily on optimization of the network services, instead the former to separate the control and forwarding plane for a centralized view of the network.\\
The fundamental parts involved in the network slicing realization for the future 5G networks are now discussed.

\subsubsection{Modularization and Function Decomposition}
The idea to modularize the architecture and to decompose the network functions has been enunciated at the beginning stages of research
in order to fulfill the above requirements.\\ 
\gls{NF}s are the entities
that furnish specific network capabilities in order to realize and support the requested services. Generally they are
software instances acting on infrastructure
resources, but can be physical, a combination
of them or virtualized, that is decoupled from the hardware it runs on; the last peculiarity will be fundamental. The general "monolithic" network functions (4g as well) are proposed to be split into basic modules, both for the \gls{CP} and \gls{UP}, allowing the definition of different logical architectures by means of the interconnection of
different subsets of NFs for CP and UP.\\
To realize the highest level of decomposition possible, it is necessary to affirm a strong distinction between NFs of
the \gls{AN} and CN, in order to achieve what is called a convergent network\footnote{It is the coexistence of different kind of information to transmit, actually voice, video and data, within a single network.}; AN/CN split is mandatory to reach  the essentials to support network
­slicing. \cite{al20185g} \cite{marsch20185g}

\subsubsection{Virtualization}
Virtualization is a main process in the network slicing architecture,
because it allows to share effectively the resource among the various
slices and it operates the abstraction of resources. Abstraction means the representation of the characteristics of the underlying resources in order to recreate a virtual scenario with same peculiarities. \\
The resources to be virtualized can be physical or already virtualized, generating a
recursive structure in the system counting different abstraction levels.
Exactly like server virtualization makes \gls{VM}s make them free from the physical hardware, network virtualization allows
to generate multiple isolated virtual networks, completely independent from the physical network and it can run over it.
The framework consists of three actors:
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{InP}: owner or a manager of the physical network. It offers resources to be virtualized and delivered to a single or multiple tenants.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tenant: leaser of the virtual resources from the InPs, which exploits to provide the necessary network services to the users. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item End user: consumes the services
supplied by the tenant.
\end{itemize}
\cite{etsi2017gs} \cite{ordonez2017network} \cite{marsch20185g}
\subsubsection{Orchestration}
Orchestration is another key point to realize
slicing and accounts the problem of allowing the coexistence and organizing all the constitutive elements of the architecture.
In a such scenario, where the entities involved
are so various, the so called orchestrator, is needed to coordinate the different services related to all the assigned requirements.\\
According to the \gls{ONF},
orchestration is defined as "\textit{the continuing process of
selecting resources to fulfill client service demands
in an optimal manner}". This means that a policy to handle the orchestrator behavior is required and which is expected to satisfy the service level agreements \gls{SLA}s associated with clients
requirements. This also has to remember
that the available resources, the demands and optimization criteria may change in time. \\
Noteworthy is that orchestration is also referred to as the defining
characteristic of an SDN controller. Orchestration process is not performed by a unique and central unity due to its complexity, but also because we want to maintain management independence and support recursion. Then a framework in which an entity performing orchestration functions is more suitable for the general architecture. \cite{ordonez2017network} \cite{marsch20185g} \cite{rostami2017orchestration}

\paragraph{Isolation}\mbox{}\\
A effective isolation is, of course, an important requirement that must
be fulfilled to let parallel slices run on a common underlying substrate. The isolation
must be understood in terms of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Performance: each slice is defined to realize specific service requirements, expressed generally as \gls{KPI}s and it must ensure them
always regardless of the congestion and performance levels on the others.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Security and privacy: attacks or issues in a slice must not affect
other slices. We say that we want each slice having
independent security functions to block unauthorized entities to have access and so reading or writing capabilities on the configuration, management, accounting information.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Management: each slice must be considered managed as a standalone network, that is as no other slices are present in parallel.
\end{itemize}
To get the wanted isolation then a set of policies and processes must be defined
at each virtualization level, they are lists of rules and settings describing how the various entities have to be isolated; a team play of both virtualization and orchestration is actually needed.\cite{ordonez2017network} \cite{rostami2017orchestration}




\subsubsection{SDN: Software-Defined Network}
In a Software-Defined Network the admin or an engineer is able to handle the data traffic remotely exploiting a centralized control without putting hands on particular switches of the network. In this context, the SDN controller tunes the switches in order to deliver the NS wherever they are needed; this is a step away from the classical architecture, where devices take their traffic decisions based on the routing tables.\\
The SDN architecture is comprehensive of, as previously explained and shown in Fig. \ref{layers}, an intermediate CP to set and abstract the underlying forwarding plane resources so that ocustom services are furnished to clients.  After having said this, it is clear that SDN is a suitable tool for implementing slicing in the 5G architecture.\\
The main components in a SDN are resources and controllers. Resource is everything useful to
provide services as answer to client requests that in this case are the infrastructure resources and NFs; also
NS in application of the recursion
principle are included. A controller, instead, is the centralized entity implemented at the control
plane and it looks for trade-offs among clients and resources because it acts as server and client at the same time via client/server contexts respectively:
\begin{itemize}
\item Client context: all the information needed by a
controller to manage the transmission to clients. It includes in turn: Resource Group, an abstraction of all the resources offered by the controller to the client via NBIs; the Client support function which contains the
necessary to ease client operations, like policies.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Server context: all the information needed by the controller to operate with a set of
underlying resources grouped in a Resource
Group via SBIs.
\end{itemize}
The idea is to transform a Resource Groups set instantiated in server contexts into those defined in client contexts, this indeed requires a SDN controller to virtualize and orchestrate the process.\\
During the virtualization function, the
SDN controller first of all makes the abstraction and the
merge or the partition of underneath resources. Then thanks to that, specific Resource Group provided by each client contexts are exploited by the client of that context to accomplish the wanted services. Afterwards, thanks to the orchestration, the SDN controller  optimally gives the chosen resources
to such separate Resource Groups. So the the services demanded by the clients are guaranteed
and at the same time the isolation is maintained among them. \\
In the proposed architecture for a SDN an admin is present to accomplish the tasks of initialization and setting of controller, of the definition
of server and client contexts and of selecting the related policies.\\
This provides a suitable solution for enabling slicing because the client context completely abstracts the set of resources into a Resource Group and furnishes the control
logic that constitute a slice which includes the related client service attributes.\\
A noteworthy peculiarity that makes SDN
ideal for slicing is recursion: thanks to the different abstraction layers
that the recursion principle makes possible, the SDN
CP may involve multiple controllers in a ranked ordered that enlarge the client-server
relationships at more levels. Now it is clear that a SDN architecture does support a
recursive composition of the slices and as consequence
the resources that a controller brings to a client as a dedicated slice (client context), can in turn be
virtualized and orchestrated by the client in the
case of being an SDN controller. Hence, the new
controller can exploit these resources it has accessed by means of
its server contexts to define and bring
new resources therefore guaranteeing effectively new slices to the
clients. \cite{ordonez2017network}


\subsubsection{NFV: Network Functions Virtualization}
Although the SDN architecture described above
gives a comprehensive view of the control plane
functionalities enabling slicing, it lacks capabilities
to efficiently manage the life cycle of
network slices and its resources. \\
VNFs move individual network functions out of dedicated hardware devices into software that runs on commodity hardware. These tasks, used by both network service providers and businesses, include firewalls, domain name system, caching or network address translation and can run as virtual machines. Then, the NFV architecture is ideal to play
this role, as it manages the infrastructure resources
and orchestrates the allocation of such resources
needed to realize VNFs and network services.\\
To benefit from the management and orchestration functionalities of NFV, the right cooperation between SDN and NFV is required.
However, embracing SDN and NFV architectures
into a common reference framework is not an
easy task. ETSI presents a framework
to integrate SDN within the reference NFV architecture. This framework incorporates two SDN
controllers, one logically placed at the tenant and
another at the InP level. The NFV architecture comprises the following
entities:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{NFVI}: a collection of resources used to
host and connect the VNFs. While SDN makes resource a generic concept,
the current resource definition in the NFV framework comprises only the infrastructure resources.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item VNFs: software-based implementations of NFs that run over the NFVI.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{MANO}: Performs all the virtualization-specific management, coordination, and automation tasks in the NFV architecture. The MANO framework comprises three functional blocks:
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{VIM}: responsible for controlling and managing the NFVI resources.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{VNFM}: performs configuration and life cycle management of the VNF(s) on its domain.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Orchestrator: according to ETSI, it has two set of functions performed by the Resource \gls{RO} and \gls{NSO}, respectively. The RO orchestrates the NFVI resources across (potentially different) VIMs. The NSO performs the life cycle management of network
services using the capabilities provided by the
RO and the (potentially different) VNFMs.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{NMS}: framework performing the general network management tasks. Although its functions are orthogonal to those defined in MANO, NMS is expected to interact with MANO entities by means of a clear separation of roles. NMS comprises:
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{EM}: responsible for the configuration,
accounting, performance, and security of a VNF.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{OSS/BSS}: a collection of systems and management applications that network service providers use to provision and operate their network
services. In terms of the roles we considered
earlier, tenants would run these applications.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The ETSI proposal includes two SDN controllers
in the architecture. Each controller centralizes
the control plane functionalities and provides an
abstract view of all the components connectivity related it manages. These controllers are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{IC}: sets up
and manages the underlying networking resources to provide the required connectivity for communicating the VNFs.
Managed by the VIM, this controller may change
infrastructure behavior on demand according to
VIM specifications adapted from tenant requests.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{TC}: instantiated in
the tenant domain as one of the VNFs or as
part of the NMS, this second controller dynamically manages the pertinent VNFs used to realize
the tenant’s network service(s). The operation and management tasks that the
TC carries out are triggered by the applications
running on top of it (e.g. the OSS).
\end{itemize}
Both controllers manage and control their
underlying resources via programmable SBI, implementing protocols like
OpenFlow, NETCONF, and I2RS. However, each
controller provides a different level of abstraction. While the IC provides an underlay to support
the deployment and connectivity of VNFs, the
TC provides an overlay comprising tenant VNFs
that define the network service a tenant independently manages on
its slices. Therefore,
the IC is not aware of the number of slices that utilize the VNFs 
or about the tenants which
operate in the slices. On the other side, for the
TC the network is abstracted in terms of VNFs,
without a knowledge of how those VNFs are physically
deployed. \\
Despite their different abstraction levels,
both controllers have to coordinate and synchronize their actions. Note that the service and
tenant concept mentioned here can be extended
to higher abstraction layers by simply applying the
recursion principle.\\
Finally an overall description of the system is given by Fig. \ref{integral}.

\section{Network Slicing} 
Now we have all the players to look inside what NGMN has proposed as the concept of network slicing: while legacy systems host multiple telecommunication
services as mobile broadband, voice, SMS on the same mobile network architecture, for
instance composed of Long Term Evolution radio access and the \gls{EPC},
future 5G networks should also support shared or dedicated logical architectures customized to the
respective telco or vertical services as \gls{eMBB}, vehicular communications, \gls{URLLC}, and \gls{mMTC}. These services need different KPIs that are
hard to be fulfilled by legacy systems which are characterized by monolithic network elements that
have tightly coupled hardware, software, and functionality. \\
Future architectures must leverage on the decoupling of software‐based network functions from the underlying infrastructure resources by
means of utilizing different resource abstraction technologies.
Furthermore exploiting modularization, resource sharing technologies such as multiplexing and multitasking (for instance
wavelength division multiplexing or radio scheduling), can be complemented
by softwarization techniques. Multitasking and multiplexing allow sharing
physical infrastructure that is not virtualized. NFV and SDN allow different tenants to share the
same general purpose hardwares. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{pics/slice.png}
\caption{An example of a network‐sliced architecture. \cite{al20185g}} 
\label{slice}
\end{figure}
In combination, these technologies allow building fully decoupled E2E networks on top of a common, shared infrastructure and consequently, multiplexing will not be done on the network level anymore, but on the
infrastructure level, as depicted in Fig. \ref{slice}, yielding better \gls{QoS} or \gls{QoE} for the subscriber since different slices will have tailored orchestration for a given
servic.\\
In principle, a network slice is a logical network that provides specific network capabilities and
network characteristics and comprises NFs, computing and networking resources to meet the
­performance requirements of the tenants. This comprises both \gls{RAN} and CN NFs that depending on the degree of freedom a tenant may have, also
the MANO components. A network slice may be dedicated to a
specific tenant or partially shared by several tenants in order to have the same performance requirements
but different security or policy settings. \\
The decoupling between the virtualized and the physical
infrastructure allows for the efficient scaling of the slices, hence suggesting the
economic viability of this approach that can adapt the used resources on demand.\\
The 5G atom proposed in Fig. \ref{atom} summarizes the discussion: use cases are in the center; the layers, from the center out, represent the requirements of the 5G use cases, the concepts that will allow network
operators to satisfy the requirements, the technologies that enable the implementation of
the concepts, and the novelties, that is, technologies that can be easily implemented due
to softwarization and virtualization techniques.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Main Services Types}
The main 5G service types typically considered are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB): related to human operations and to an enhanced access to multimedia content, services and data with improved performance with an increasing user experience. This service type, which can be seen as an evolution of the services today provided by
4G networks, covers use cases with very different requirements, ranging from hotspot characterized by a high user density and very high traffic capacity and low user mobility, to wide area coverage cases with medium to high user mobility; besides the need for seamless radio coverage practically
anywhere and anytime with visibly is requested to improve user data rates;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ultra‐reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC): related to use cases with tight requirements for capabilities such as latency, reliability and availability. Examples include the wireless
control of industrial manufacturing or production processes, remote medical surgery, distribution automation in a smart grid, transportation safety, etc. It is expected that URLLC services will provide a main part of the foundations for the 4th industrial revolution (often referred to as
Industry 4.0) and have a substantial impact on industries far beyond the information and communication technology industry;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Massive machine‐type communications (mMTC): capturing services that are characterized by
a very large number of connected devices typically transmitting a relatively low volume of non delay sensitive data. However, the key challenge is here that devices are usually required to be
low-cost, and have a very long battery lifetime. Key examples for this service type would be logistics applications, smart metering, or for instance
agricultural applications where small, low‐cost and low‐power sensors are sprinkled over large
areas to measure ground humidity, fertility and what concerns Intern of Things in general.
\end{itemize}
The concept of network slicing will be implemented at the beginning of the 5G era in order to realize these main services as slices and their 8 most important KPI are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Peak data rate, referring to the maximum achievable data rate in ideal conditions per user or
device in bits per second. The minimum 5G requirements for peak data rate are 20 Gbps in the
downlink and 10 Gbps in the uplink;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item User experienced data rate, referring to the achievable data rate that is available ubiquitously
across the coverage area to a mobile user or device in bits per second. This KPI corresponds to the
5\% point of the cumulative distribution function of the user throughput and can be seen as
a kind of minimum user experience in the coverage area. This requirement is set to
100 Mbps in the DL and 50 Mbps in the UL;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Average spectral efficiency, also known as spectrum efficiency and defined as the average data
throughput per unit of spectrum resource and per cell in bps/Hz/cell. Again, the minimum requirements depend on the test environments as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Indoor Hotspot: 9 bps/Hz/cell in the DL, 6.75 bps/Hz/cell in the UL;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Dense Urban: 7.8 bps/Hz/cell in the DL, 5.4 bps/Hz/cell in the UL;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rural: 3.3 bps/Hz/cell in the DL, 1.6 bps/Hz/cell in the UL.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Area traffic capacity, defined as the total traffic throughput served per geographic area in Mbps/m2, defined only for the indoor hotspot case, with a target of 10 Mbps/m$^2$ for
the downlink;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item User plane latency, that is the contribution of the radio network to the time from when the
source sends a packet to when the destination receives it and the latency
requirement is set to 4 ms for eMBB services and 1 ms for URLLC;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Connection density, corresponding to the total number of connected 
per unit area, targeting 1000000 devices per km$^2$ for mMTC services;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Energy efficiency, refers to the quantity of information bits transmitted to or received from users, per unit of energy consumption of the RAN and on the device side to the
quantity of information bits per unit of energy consumption of the communication module; both cases in bits/Joule. Air interfaces must have the capability to support a high sleep ratio and long sleep duration;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mobility, here defined as the maximum speed at which a defined QoS and
seamless transfer between radio nodes which may belong to different layers or radio access
technologies can be achieved. For the rural test environment, the normalized traffic channel link
data rate at 500 km/h, reflecting the average user spectral efficiency, must be larger than 0.45 bps/Hz
in the uplink.
\end{itemize}
The following web-spider diagrams in Fig. \ref{cap1}-\ref{cap2}, sum up optimally these capabilities and how they have to be split to realize each particular slice

\section{5G Architecture}
3GPP has split 5G specifications in
two phases: the first called Release-15 and released on August 2018 addressing
a urgent subset of commercial
needs; the second, called Release-16 is planned to be completed by March
2020 addressing all identified use cases and
requirements. 
Now, by giving a look at Release-15 a representation of 5G architecuture is illustrated in order to understand how the novel concept of netowork slicing is implemented; Fig. \ref{archite}

\end{figure}
Compared to the LTE architecture, 3GPP
has decided to modularize mainly the CN
and allocate slice-related NFs inside it. The CN
control plane functions are now described:
\begin{itemize}
\item Core access and mobility management function
(AMF) necessaru mobility management, access
authentication and authorization, security
anchor functions and context management;

\item Session management function (SMF) handles session
management, IP address allocation, traffic
steering, selection and control of UP functions,
control part of policy enforcement,
and QoS;

\item \gls{PCF} specifies an unified policy
framework to govern network behavior and policy
rules to control plane functions;

\item \gls{NEF} provides
to securely expose the services and
capabilities provided by NFs;

\item \gls{NRF} is a service discovery
function used by NF instances;

\item Unified data management (UDM) concerns the authentication
credential repository and processing
function, user identification handling, subscription
management;

\item Authentication server function (AUSF): supports
the authentication server;

\item \gls{N3IWF} is necessary to support:
IPsec tunnel establishment, relay signaling
between user equipment and AMF,
relay user plane packets between UE and UPF, anchor point within non-3GPP access networks;

\item \gls{UDR} stores subscription
and policy data;
\end{itemize}
The architecture also contains the following
functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item User plane function (UPF) is an anchor point for
inter/intra-radio access technology
mobility and necessary for packet routing and forwarding,
QoS handling for the user plane;

\item \gls{NSSF} supports
the functionality to bind a user equipment with a
specific slice;

\item \gls{AF} influences traffic
routing, accesses the NEF, interacts with PCF;
\end{itemize}
5G allows user equipments to concurrently
access multiple
network slices concurrently, but in such a
case, only a single AMF will be used for all slices.
It has been agreed that they cannot use more
than eight slices in parallel.
To identify slices, the network slice selection assistance
information is used and consists of
the slice/service type, an entity which identifies the
NFs a slice provides. 3GPP has
standardized 3 slice/service type values,one for eMBB,
2 for URLLC and 3 for MIoT. Therefore, CN
is responsible to authorize the attachment of UE
to a slice.
The management functions for network
slices are called \gls{CSMF} and \gls{NSMF}. The CSMF is used
to translate the communication service requirements
to network slice requirements (capacity,
throughput, delay, number of users, geographical
identifications, authentication level). The
NSMF is responsible for managing and orchestrating
the life cycle of a network slice. This life cycle
consists of the following phases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Preparation phase;

\item Instantiation, configuration, and activation
phase;

\item Runtime phase;

\item Decommissioning phase;

\end{itemize}
The first phase involves the creation and verification
of a slice template. During the second phase,
all shared or dedicated NFs and resources are
allocated and configured. During the third phase,
a network slice is essentially a fully operational
network, and monitoring and optimization functions
are also performed. The last phase is related
to the deactivation of a slice and the decommissioning
of previously allocated resources.

%\section{Actual Implementations}
%Some early trials have been conducted demonstrating network slicing with
%cross-industry collaboration among operators, vendors, and vertical industries.
%Two specific examples are given here.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Deutsche Telekom and Huawei demonstration of E2E autonomous network slicing. In this demo, eMBB, mMTC and uRLLC are envisaged as network classes that could be built as slices.
%E2E network slicing included not only the core network and RAN, but also
%interconnecting transport networks. The demo implements E2E network slicing automation based on service oriented network auto creation. It uses software-defined topology, software-defined protocol, and
%software-defined resource allocation to ensure the automatic implementation of slice management, service deployment, resource scheduling, and fault recovery.
%\end{itemize}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item SK Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and Ericsson have jointly built
%and demonstrated a trial network on federated network slicing for roaming, making SK Telecom and DT network slices available in each operators footprint, connecting South Korea and Germany. The demonstration
%was hosted at Deutsche Telekom's corporate R\&D center in Bonn, Germany and Sk Telecoms 5G testbed at Yeongjongdo (the BMW driving center) in Korea. The
%demo featured an industrial maintenance use case involving a repair worker
%communicating via augmented reality with support colleagues in a visited network. The scenario used local breakout and edge cloud to enable
%the best service experience in terms of latency and throughput for the augmented reality
%repairman.
